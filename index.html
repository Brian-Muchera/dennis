<h1 style="color:blue">A MESSAGE TO ALL KENYAN PARENTS IN THIS PERIOD OF COVID 19</h1>
<h2><i>BY Otwoma Dennis</i></h2>

<p><h4>It has been more than 200 days since the covid 19 pandemic hit Kenya in March 2020, and since then the graph has been
       flactuating, the number of new cases has been rising and falling.</h4></p>
<p>When the pandemic hit the country, the ministry ordered students in all education sectors from higher level learning 
to kindergarten to shut down or rather stop learning activities. After then, 5 months down the line, the students have been
staying home following the closure, however, in mid september, the number of new infections was drasctically decresing
this was a good landmark towards fighting covid, following that, the ministry of education led by prof George Magoha planned phased
reopening and grade 4, standard 8 and form 4 students were allowed to report back.</p>
<p>However, when the the students mentioned above reported physically, the number of new infections has started rising again,
<b>this has raised alarm among many parents</b>, as the pandemic has hit other schools, and has even lead to death in
the affected instituitons.</p>
<p><h2 class="border">THIS IS WHAT PARENTS NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND</h2></p>
<p>It is a high time we face this problem of covid and schooling instead of freakong away from it, the ministry has put in
all the effort to make sure that the students get back to school, <h3>know this</h3> if we continue pushing the ministry to tell 
children to close and reopen in January 2021, by then the infections might be higher than even now <b>what then</b>, we will again tell the m
ministry to close and reopen in march or something, then by then the infections hit the peakagain by the time we reach that time
, this will continue and the children might end up staying home forever, there is no hope for vaccine in the near future and that is
something we need to know.</p>
<h3 style="color:purple"><i><u>WHY NOT KEEP THE KIDS AT HOME</u></i><h3>
<p class="roundwrap">we need to understand the more the kids stay home is the more they are exposed to negativities, girls in other rural
areas being married off forcefully, others are being circumcised, we have also heard cases of rape and continued rising
cases of early pregnancy...for example, you might be able to protect your kid from FGM but to some extent fail to protect
her from early pregnancy since you are not with her all the time, this is almost impossible if the kids are at school, on 
the other hand, for the boys, the more they stay at home is the more their morale for going back to school is reduced, 
know you that the boys, some of them have already started doing petty jobs, and are testing money, believe me, by the time 
we tell them to report back in January, upto 9% percent of them will refuse to go back....Is this what we want for our kids?</p>

<h3>SO WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE, THE CHOICE IS YOURS AS A PARENT<h3>
